Adds additional features to the CRM functionality of the Users Insights plugin.

== Description ==
Extends the default CRM functionality of the [Users Insights plugin](https://usersinsights.com/) with the following features:
* Custom User Fields : when creating a custom user field, it gives you an option to select existing user meta keys. It lists all of the existing user meta keys, except the WordPress core keys and the private keys (starting with _).
* User Notes: adds an option to create sticky notes. Each note in the user profile section has an option to be sticked to top. The sticky notes are in a different color so they can be different from the regular notes.
* User Groups: adds an option to select an icon when creating a user group. After that, the group is displayed with the icon in the users table and user profile section.
* User Groups: extends the default color options with darker colors, so that when icons are used for user groups, they can be better visible with darker colors.
